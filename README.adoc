Beer Catalogue 

This file shows how to use the API created with Spring Data REST

Defining the domain

	For this basic Spring Data applicattion, we need to define some object like Beer and Manufacturer.
	They're related by one-to-many relation as one Manufacture can have several Beers, but one Beer can only have one Manufacturer



Defining the repositories

	We have to define one repository for each object.
	The repositories extend the PagingAndSortingRepository, so we can use pagination and sorting, and also the CrudRepository permits search very easily for any attribute of the objects 
	

Run and test

	In the file BeerCatalogueApplication we can find the data is proloaded.

Run the app 

	$ mvn spring-boot:run

List of beers:

	$ curl localhost:8080/beers

List of manufacturers

	$ curl localhost:8080/manufacturers

Parameters for paging,sorting 

	page: The page number to access (0 indexed, defaults to 0).
	size: The page size requested (defaults to 20).
	sort: A collection of sort directives in the format ($propertyname,)+[asc|desc]?

Create a new Manufacturer

	$ curl -i -X POST -d '{"name": "Mahou","nationality": "Spain"}' -H "Content-Type: application/json" localhost:8080/manufacturers
	
	It returned a location http://localhost:8080/manufacturers/10, so we can relate to the resource we just created with this link .

Create a new Beer

	$ curl -X POST -d '{"name": "5 estrellas", "graduation":5, "type":"Lager", "description":"Blond lager", "manufacturer":"http://localhost:8080/manufacturers/10"}' -H "Content-Type: application/json" localhost:8080/beers
	

Search for any of the beer attributes like name, type, nationality or manufacturer

	$ curl http://localhost:8080/search/type/Lager
	$ curl http://localhost:8080/search/manufacturer/Heineken
	
	Returns the list of beers that match any of these parameters
